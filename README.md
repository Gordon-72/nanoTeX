A custom installer for TeX Live
--------------------------------

FasTeX is a custom installer for TeX Live distribution. Its purpose is to provide a minimal TeX Live distribution, which can be downloaded quickly and which takes up little space. The script installs the TeX Live infrastructure only and a series of packages that are considered basic for each user. Furthermore, during installation the user can decide whether to install lists of particular packages, according to his needs. For example, a humanist might want to install packages to write in Greek, while a mathematician will need some classic mathematic packages.
The installation omits downloading the documentation and the sources of the packages, which take up a lot of space and which are often never consulted. However, it is always possible to install individual packages later, using the TeX Live Manager program.
